# Game Picker

## Description

I have created this to keep track of games I am playing or I am currently playing, I have the overall logic worked out I am going make an alternate version in the future so that I can selfhost a website to check or view my games.

## To do list

- Make to more random options, I think if a game is finished there could be a replay option if you are currently playing there could be an option for that and if you have not started it yet then you can pick that.

- More fields for the table for the above point.

- more options for edit for the above point.
